The outline "March of the Solvation Robots" should be structured around a mindmap
where PCMSolver and the variational formulation are at the center.

The slide on solvation models should first outline similarities and then differences between
implicit and explicit models. Everything should be anchored to a picture.

1. "You see what happens when you find a stranger in the alps?"

2. "Who cares?"
